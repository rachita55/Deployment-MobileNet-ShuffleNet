# Deployment-MobileNet-ShuffleNet
Deployment of Cifar 10 dataset using MobileNet v1 &amp; ShuffleNet v1 architectures 

Earlier we developed the ShuffleNet V1 architechture on CIFAR-10 dataset (refer : https://github.com/rachita55/Deep-Learning-ShuffleNet-v1) playing around with different hyperparameters to achieve our best accuracy of 88.53%

In this assignment, using the weights generated by the model, we will be deploying this architecture (along with MobileNet v1)
